# Clothes4Money and Wirtschafts-Info Demos

This repository contains two small static website examples:

1. **Clothes4Money** – a minimal online shop for a fictional streetwear brand (original demo). Files are `index.html`, `cart.html`, `checkout.html`, `style.css` and `script.js`.
2. **Wirtschafts-Info** – a simple informational page about economic topics inspired by the layout of wirtschafts-fakten.de but with original text and placeholder images. Located in the `economyfacts/` directory.

Both sites can be viewed by opening their respective `index.html` files in a browser.
